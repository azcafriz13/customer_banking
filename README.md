## Challenge for Module 3: Banking System Classes and Functions
# Repository:  customer_banking 
Submitted by CA Frisby
This challenge creates the following files:
1.  Account:  This is a class definition for account balance and interest earned.
2.  savings_account:  This is a defined function for calculating interest and new balance.
3.  cd_account: Almost identical to savings_account, this is also a function file, except uses text related to cd instead of savings.
4.  savings_account:  This is the main program, including user inputs for account balance, interest rate, and term. 
        It then returns the new balances and interest earned for the two previous file functions.

The files includes code from "starter files" provided by ASU boot camp.
Other references included the class assignments and class slides.
